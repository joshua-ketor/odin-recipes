		<h2>Description</h2>

		<p>This crockpot Thai chicken is a family-pleasing slow cooker
		recipe that's super easy to make. Start this dish in the
		morning, and it will be ready when you get home. Just add your
	   	favourite rice. Chicken thighs are better in this recipe than
		breast meat, which dries out in the crock poit; plus, thighs
		are more economical. The strength of the hot salsa dissipates
		when cooked, so this dish is not too spicy. You may even want
		to serve hot-sauce as an accompaniment.
		</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup hot salsa</li>
			<li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup chunky peanut
				butter
			</li>
			<li><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup light coconut
				milk
			</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons lime juice</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger</li>
			<li>2 pounds skinless chicken thighs</li>
			<li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup chopped peanuts,
				for topping
			</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons chopped cilantro, for topping</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>Combine salsa, peanut butter, coconut milk, lime juice,
				soy sauce, sugar, and ginger in the slow cooker; mix
				well. Place chicken thighs in sauce; spoon sauce over
				chicken to coat.
			</li>
			<li>Cover and cook on Low until chicken is very tender and
				sauce has thickened, 8 to 9 hours. A meat thermometer
				inserted into the thickest part of a thigh should read
				at least 165 degrees F(74 degrees C). Garnish with
				peanuts and cilantro before serving.
			</li>
		</ol>
