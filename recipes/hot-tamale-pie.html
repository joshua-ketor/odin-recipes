        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>While this recipe for tamale pie has very little to do with
            south-of-the-border namesake, it's really delicious all
            the same.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Cooking spray</li>
            <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>2 cups diced poblano peppers</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) jar salsa</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> dried oregano</li>
            <li>2 (8.5 ounce) boxes dry corn muffin mix (such as
                Jiffy), divided
            </li>
            <li>2 eggs, divided</li>
            <li><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cup milk, divided</li>
            <li>8 ounces frozen corn, thawed</li>
            <li>4 ounces shredded Chedder cheese, divided</li>
            <li>4 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese, divided</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350
                degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch casserole
                dish with cooking spray.
            </li>
            <li>Cook and stir ground beef in a Dutch oven over
                medium-high heat until meat starts to brown and release
                its juices, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium
                and stir in poblano peppers, salsa, salt, dried
                chipotle pepper, and oregano. Cook and stir until beef
                is crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li> Meanwhile, whisk one package corn muffin mix in a
                large bowl with one egg and 1/3 cup of milk until
                combined; spread into the prepared baking dish.
                Sprinkle corn over top, followed by 1/2 of the Cheddar
                and 1/2 of the Montery Jack. Spread beef mixture over
                tehe cheeses.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix remaining corn muffin mix, egg, milk, Cheddar, and
                Monterey Jack in a bowl; carefully spread over beef
                mixture to within 1/2 inch of the edges of the dish.
            </li>
            <li>Back in the preheated oven until golden brown, 50 to
                60 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
